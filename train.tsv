BlackEnergy attack	Win32/Industroyer	delivery	However, before diving into those details, the following simplified schematic shows the connections between the components of the malware  Support for four different industrial control protocols, specified in the standards listed below, has been implemented by the malware authors: • IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101) • IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104) • IEC 61850 • OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) In addition to all that, the malware authors also wrote a tool that implements a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a particular family of protection relays, specifically the Siemens SIPROTEC range All this considered, the Win32/Industroyer malware authors show an intensive focus that suggests they are highly specialized in industrial control systems The capabilities of this malware are significant When compared to the toolset used by threat actors in the 2015 attacks against the Ukrainian power grid which culminated in a black out on December 23, 2015 (BlackEnergy, KillDisk, and other components, including legitimate remote access software) the gang behind Industroyer are more advanced, since they went to great lengths to create malware capable of directly controlling switches and circuit breakers We have seen indications that  Figure 1 Simplified schematic of Win32/Industroyer components  While some components (e g Data wiper) are similar in concept to the 2015 BlackEnergy attacks against power grid companies in Ukraine, we don’t see any link between those attacks and the code in this malware  Win32/Industroyer  Main backdoor  Once connected to its remote C&C server, the main backdoor component sends the following data in a POST-request:  We refer to the core component of Industroyer as the main backdoor .
